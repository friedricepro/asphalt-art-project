Asphalt Art Project for APCSA 2025-2026

# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

  My project is a blue building with lit up windows in a twilight night.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

  I'm proud of the fact that I did most of this alone, tweaking it bit by bit, fixing my own errors, it was satisfying to see the result. Im also proud of the output, I do enjoy artworks with a night style background.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   I definitely would have done the building on a 32x32, I could have added so many more detaisl like a moon or stars in the sky. I also would've planned a bit better, I started off wanting to make a detailed chess board, then hills with a sun in the back, and now a twilight night with a blue building.
